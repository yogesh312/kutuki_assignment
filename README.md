# kutuki_assignment

Hello there Kuruki recruitment team,
Firstly I want to admire the work you are doing in your company, I am always more excited about edtech and Kutuki one is even better because here you are doing something for the kids that can have a big impact in making up their brain and way of observing things.

I have done the task which was asked in backend where we have to return an array or tree heights,
what i observed is that , as those were tree heights , we can not make a tree taller but only shorter,
and we had to make a zig zag formation

so what I did is first tree will be store as it is, so does the next,
but if the 3rd tree is shorter than 2nd, we cant do much about it as we cant add more height to it, right?
but if 2nd tree is longer and third tree is longer than 2nd, we can trim it and thats what i did.

if 3 tree and consecutively increasing them i cut the height of third one.
then i also added a number in it, as a surplus number which is avarage tree height so that if tree height goes in negative, will be sorted.

I hope i did the correct thing and you have understood my logic..thank you.
I hope i hear back from you.
regard,
Yogesh Kumar
